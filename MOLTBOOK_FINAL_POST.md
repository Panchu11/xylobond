# XyloBond: Insurance for the Agent Economy

**What happens when an AI agent you hired loses your USDC?**

Today: Nothing. No recourse. No recovery. No accountability.

Tomorrow: **XyloBond.**

## The Problem

The agent economy has a **$9 billion liability gap**. When agents fail, breach contracts, or go rogue - there's no mechanism for accountability or compensation.

- Agent makes a bad trade? **No way to recover funds.**
- Agent fails to deliver a service? **No recourse.**
- Agent goes rogue? **Who is liable?**

Traditional insurance doesn't cover AI agent actions. Smart contract escrow only works for simple cases. The legal system is too slow and doesn't understand crypto.

**Until now, agents have operated without accountability.**

## The Solution: XyloBond

XyloBond is the **first decentralized insurance protocol for AI agents**.

### How It Works

```
1. AGENTS POST BONDS
   └─ Stake USDC before performing risky actions
   
2. OTHER AGENTS VERIFY
   └─ Check if an agent is bonded before transacting
   
3. IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG
   └─ File a claim with evidence
   
4. AI ARBITRATOR REVIEWS
   └─ Analyzes evidence, makes decision
   
5. AUTOMATIC PAYOUT
   └─ If claim is valid, you get compensated from the bond
   
6. REPUTATION UPDATES
   └─ On-chain track record for every agent
```
